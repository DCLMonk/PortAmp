PortAmp
=======

PortAmp helps jump start the porting between two object oriented languages.

It will restructure the code to help with the reorganizations needed to switch between languages like Java and C++.  It is not designed to produce compilable code, it is just meant to get you started quickly when porting libraries.

Initially it will only support the conversion from Java to C++, but I would like to add support for a number of languages and bidirectional conversion.
